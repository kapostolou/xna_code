Instructions: Draw a simple convex polygon by clicking the mouse, close it by clicking at the beginning, then press the left trigger to choose a direction and the A and Y buttons to rotate the polygon

TODO: Check convexivity/decompose to convex parts, run the GJK on 2 polygons 
moved by the triggers, get this to use a mesh output by Blender3D or other modelling programs
